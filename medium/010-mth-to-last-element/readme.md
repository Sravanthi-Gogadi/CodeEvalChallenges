<h2>Mth to last element</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Write a program which determines the M<sup>th</sup> to the last element in a list.
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    The first argument is a path to a file. The file contains the series of space delimited characters followed by
    an integer. The integer represents an index in the list (1-based), one per line.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre class="description-input-output">a b c d 4
e f g h 2</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>
<p>
    Print to stdout the M<sup>th</sup> element from the end of the list, one per line. If the index is larger than
    the number of elements in the list, ignore that input.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre class="description-input-output">a
g</pre>
